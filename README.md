# html-css-dev-exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to assess your ability to craft custom HTML5 **targeting email clients**, using common elements and good CSS. The end result should be well-formed HTML5 markup with all CSS in inlined `style` attributes.

The grading criteria is simple:
1. How well does your resulting page conform to the prototype design?
2. How well did you follow the directions in the [Requirements](https://github.com/upper-hand/html-css-dev-exercise/tree/master#requirements) section below?

You can access the design [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperhand-dev/dev-exercises/uh_newbookings.jpg) or [check it out below](https://github.com/upper-hand/html-css-dev-exercise/tree/master#the-prototype-design).

## Process
1. Fork this repository
2. Do your work
3. Create a PR from your forked repo to `master` on this repo, and submit it
4. Make sure that you follow best practices for HTML emails ([here's a helpful link](https://gist.github.com/janogarcia/4977a2346cbc7e52334b))

## Assets
You will need two additional assets for your translation of the design.
- the [generic customer logo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperhand-dev/dev-exercises/generic-logo.jpg) (in the header)
- the [Upper Hand Logo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperhand-dev/dev-exercises/UH_Logo_Web.png) (in the footer)

## Requirements
- the faces for the individual clients are taken from http://uifaces.com -- you should choose two different faces to link to for the images
- the cards and footer should be centered on the page
- any links in the page should link to http://example.com
- any images should link to their source as opposed to using inlined Base64 encoded image data
- any emails in the page should be links using the [mailto: protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767737(v=vs.85).aspx)
- the page should have a background color of `#EEF1F5` (`rgb(238,241,245)`)
- any green text should use a font color of `#5DD979` (`rgb(93,217,121)`)
- your final product should be a single `index.html` file
